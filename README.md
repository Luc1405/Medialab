# Medialab
GitHub Repo for our Medialab 1 project, where we aim to increase engagement within a (LinkedIn) community, so that members will keep signed on for years. We will be creating a PWA to aid in this, which will allow the owner of the community to better schedule events, send push-notifications to members, and help members engage in the activities organized by the community.

# Usage
